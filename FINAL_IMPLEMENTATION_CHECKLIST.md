## Development Best Practices (Added: Jan 7, 2024)
1. Port Management:
   ```bash
   # Clear port 3000 if in use
   lsof -i :3000 | grep LISTEN | awk '{print $2}' | xargs kill -9
   ```
2. Code Organization:
   - Use Pages Router for routing
   - Keep components in src/components
   - Keep hooks in src/lib/hooks
   - Keep types in src/lib/types
3. Testing Protocol:
   - Test all flows in incognito/private window

## Key Implementation Notes

### Challenges Overcome
1. **Auth Package Migration** (Jan 7, 2024)
   - Issue: Initially used deprecated @supabase/auth-helpers
   - Solution: Migrated to @supabase/ssr package
   
2. **UI Component Setup** (Jan 7, 2024)
   - Issue: Direct shadcn/ui installation failed
   - Solution: Manual component installation with proper dependencies
   
3. **TypeScript Path Resolution** (Jan 7, 2024)
   - Issue: Module resolution for @/* paths
   - Solution: Updated tsconfig.json with correct path aliases

4. **Routing System Conflict** (Jan 7, 2024)
   - Issue: Dual routing systems (App Router and Pages Router) causing conflicts
   - Impact: Server error on root route
   - Solution: 
     - Removed App Router (/app directory)
     - Standardized on Pages Router for MVP
     - Documented decision in architecture
   - Risk Level: 1/10 (Very low risk, no downstream effects)
   - Rationale: Simplified architecture, better TypeScript support for MVP phase

5. **Auth-Database Synchronization** (Jan 7, 2024)
   - Issue: Messages failing with foreign key constraint violation
   - Root Cause: Gap between Supabase Auth and public users table
   - Impact: Users could authenticate but couldn't send messages
   - Technical Details:
     - Auth system created users in auth.users
     - But no corresponding record in public.users table
     - Foreign key constraint in messages table failed
   - Solution:
     - Modified signUp flow to create user record in public.users table
     - Added manual user record creation for existing auth users
     - Enhanced error handling and logging for debugging
   - Risk Level: 2/10 (Low risk, one-time fix)
   - Learnings:
     - Need to maintain consistency between auth and public schemas
     - Important to handle both auth signup and user record creation atomically
     - Added comprehensive logging for auth state debugging

6. **shadcn-chat Component Dependencies** (Jan 7, 2024)
   - Issue: Missing required shadcn/ui base components
   - Impact: Build errors when integrating shadcn-chat
   - Technical Details:
     - shadcn-chat requires specific base components (Avatar, Button)
     - Missing utility functions (cn) and dependencies
   - Debug Process:
     1. Error Analysis:
        - Identified missing imports in chat-bubble.tsx
        - Traced dependency chain to base components
     2. Component Resolution:
        ```bash
        # Required Dependencies
        npm install @radix-ui/react-avatar
        npm install @radix-ui/react-slot
        npm install class-variance-authority
        npm install clsx tailwind-merge
        ```
     3. Component Creation:
        - Created src/components/ui/avatar.tsx
        - Created src/components/ui/button.tsx
        - Added src/lib/utils.ts
     4. Integration Verification:
        - Tested component rendering
        - Verified style application
        - Checked real-time updates
   - Solution:
     - Created required base components manually
     - Added necessary dependencies
     - Implemented utility functions
   - Risk Level: 1/10 (Very low risk, standard component setup)
   - Learnings:
     - shadcn-chat assumes presence of base shadcn/ui components
     - Important to check component dependencies before integration
     - Manual component setup provides better control over dependencies
     - Document all component dependencies clearly

7. **Message Bubble Alignment** (Jan 7, 2024)
   - Issue: Message bubbles were centering within container instead of hugging left/right
   - Impact: Poor visual hierarchy and chat readability
   - Technical Details:
     - ChatBubble component had correct alignment classes (`self-start`/`self-end`)
     - But parent container lacked proper flex layout to respect these classes
   - Root Cause Analysis:
     - Container div used `space-y-4` for spacing
     - Missing `flex flex-col` layout properties
     - Child alignment properties couldn't take effect without flex context
   - Solution:
     - Added `flex flex-col` to message container
     - Maintained existing `space-y-4` for message spacing
     - Allowed ChatBubble's `self-start`/`self-end` to work properly
   - Risk Level: 1/10 (Very low risk, CSS-only change)
   - Verification:
     - Messages from current user align right
     - Messages from other users align left
     - Spacing between messages maintained
     - Scroll behavior unaffected

8. **Header Position After Message Send** (Jan 7, 2024)
   - Issue: Header would drift up out of view after sending messages with overflow content
   - Impact: Poor UX, loss of navigation context
   - Technical Details:
     - Header was part of the same overflow context as message content
     - `scrollToBottom()` after message send affected entire container
   - Root Cause Analysis:
     - `overflow-hidden` was set too high in component tree
     - Scroll behavior wasn't properly isolated to message area
     - Header lacked its own fixed position context
   - Solution:
     - Restructured layout hierarchy in AppLayout
     - Isolated content area overflow from header
     - Created separate overflow contexts for better scroll control
   - Risk Level: 2/10 (Low risk, layout structure change)
   - Verification:
     - Header stays fixed on page load
     - Header remains visible during normal scrolling
     - Header maintains position after message send
     - Scroll-to-bottom still works for new messages

### Test Protocol
1. Component Loading:
   ```bash
   # Clear cache and storage
   1. DevTools → Application → Clear Storage
   2. Verify clean state
   ```
2. Message Display:
   - Sign in and open channel
   - Verify visual elements:
     - Message bubbles
     - Avatars
     - Timestamps
3. Message Input:
   - Test all input methods:
     - Enter key
     - Send button
     - Loading states
4. Real-time Updates:
   - Verify instant updates
   - Check scroll behavior
   - Monitor for duplicates
