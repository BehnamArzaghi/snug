## **4. Detailed Feature Descriptions & Potential Ambiguities**

This section clarifies **common questions** or **ambiguous points** that might arise during development.

### 4.1 **Channels**

1. **Public vs. Private Channels**  
   - **Definition**:  
     - **Public** channels: visible to all registered users, joinable with no invitation.  
     - **Private** channels: invite-only, hidden from non-members.  
   - **Key Questions**:  
     - How do we handle *channel discoverability* for private channels?  
       - **Answer**: Private channels only appear in a user’s list if they’ve been explicitly invited.  
     - Should we allow “secret” channels with no listing at all?  
       - **Answer**: This might be a v2 feature if needed by enterprise customers. Right now, private is sufficient.  

2. **Duplicate Channel Names**  
   - **Decision**: Strictly enforce unique names for the entire workspace to avoid confusion.  
   - **Implementation Note**: If a user attempts to create a channel that already exists (case-insensitive match), show a clear error message.

3. **Archived Channels**  
   - **Purpose**: Keep workspace tidy without losing historical data.  
   - **Implementation Detail**:  
     - Mark an archived channel as read-only.  
     - Keep it accessible for compliance or reference.  
   - **Open Question**: Should channel membership remain intact for references, or do we remove membership data?  
     - **Answer**: Retain membership so that user references are preserved.

### 4.2 **AI Avatar**

1. **AI Configuration**  
   - **Personalization**: Each user can fill out a short “style guide” or select from predefined templates (formal, casual, technical, etc.).  
   - **Scope**: AI responds only if:  
     1. The user toggled it on.  
     2. The user is offline (after X minutes of inactivity, e.g., 5 minutes).  
   - **Open Question**: Should AI respond in DMs or only in channels?  
     - **Answer**: Start with channels only. DMs may be added if testing reveals strong demand.

2. **Context Size & Performance**  
   - **Performance Impact**: Large context windows (e.g., last 50 messages) might slow response times or degrade AI accuracy.  
   - **Limit**: 10–20 messages for initial MVP.  
   - **Open Question**: What if a user wants a bigger context (like 100 messages)?  
     - **Answer**: We can A/B test performance and see if the majority of users want deeper references. Potential future expansion.

3. **Ethical & Privacy Considerations**  
   - **AI Checking Private Data**: Must ensure the AI only reads messages from channels the user has access to.  
   - **Opt-Out**: Team members might not want an AI impersonating them. Must make it easy to opt out.  

### 4.3 **File Upload & Preview**

1. **Supported File Types**  
   - **Initial Scope**: JPG, PNG, GIF (images up to 5MB).  
   - **Open Question**: Do we allow PDFs or other doc formats for preview?  
     - **Answer**: Possibly in a future release. For MVP, focus on images.  

2. **Versioning**  
   - **Need**: Designers often upload multiple versions of the same file.  
   - **Implementation**: Suffix filenames (e.g., `mockup_v2.png`). Possibly show an “updated design” label.  
   - **Open Question**: Should we store multiple versions under the same file ID for a unified history?  
     - **Answer**: That’s a bigger feature. For now, separate uploads with distinct URLs are acceptable.

3. **Security & Access**  
   - **Bucket Privacy**: Use Supabase RLS to ensure only authenticated users can access files.  
   - **Public vs. Private Links**: For ease, we might keep attachments public if non-sensitive, but this raises compliance questions.  
   - **Open Question**: Do we need per-channel restricted access on files?  
     - **Answer**: Possibly. If the channel is private, the file links might require tokens for access.

### 4.4 **Search & Presence**

1. **Search**  
   - **Implementation**: Already using `pg_trgm` for fuzzy text search with GIN indexes.  
   - **Open Question**: Do we include attached file content (OCR or metadata)?  
     - **Answer**: Out of scope for MVP. Possibly future doc search with separate indexing.

2. **Presence**  
   - **Current**: Basic online/offline; partial real-time “ping.”  
   - **Open Question**: How do we handle short idle states vs. long offline states?  
     - **Answer**: “Idle” after 10 min inactivity, “Offline” after 30 min or explicit sign-out.

3. **AI Engine** (e.g., OpenAI GPT or local LLM) for auto-response.  
4. **Third-party Services**: Potential CDNs, image processing, and AI hosting.

---

## **9. Risks & Mitigations**

1. **AI Misinterpretation**: AI might generate irrelevant or inappropriate content.  
   - *Mitigation*: Restrict AI context to relevant channels, user toggles, disclaimers.  
2. **File Security**: Public links for private channels could leak.  
   - *Mitigation*: Strict RLS policies, private buckets by default.  
3. **Performance Bottlenecks**: Large file or AI context requests slow down.  
   - *Mitigation*: Limit file size to 5MB, keep AI context to 10–20 messages initially, scale up if testing is positive.

---

## **10. Open Questions & Next Steps**

1. **AI in Direct Messages**: Decide if we want to let AI respond in DMs.  
2. **Threading & Reactions**: These Slack-like features may improve user experience—do we incorporate them sooner?  
3. **Extended File Types**: Should we add more doc types (like PDFs, Word docs) for previews?  
4. **Compliance Requirements**: If enterprise clients need advanced logging or data export, is that in scope now or for future releases?

**Decision-Making Process**: The product manager (or interim owner while you’re away) will consult the dev team and design lead. If strategic direction is unclear or a major pivot is required, they’ll schedule a stakeholder meeting.

### **Final Notes**

This **expanded PRD** is meant to **guide all stakeholders** through **development, testing, and future planning**. By addressing open questions (channel privacy, file storage, AI scope, etc.) and clarifying decisions, your team can refer back to this document for consistent direction while you’re on vacation.

If **further ambiguities** arise that aren’t addressed here, the team should:
1. Document the question in the project’s knowledge base.  
2. Gather context from relevant sections (e.g., “Channels” in Section 4.1).  
3. Raise it in a weekly product sync or schedule an ad-hoc discussion with the product manager and design lead.  

With these guidelines, the project should maintain momentum, ensuring a well-coordinated and user-centric build process.
