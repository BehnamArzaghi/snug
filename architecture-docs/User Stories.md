Below are three **user stories** that touch on most of the features in the **refined flow structure** and **database interaction model**—they help verify that your entire stack is wired up correctly, from **user management** to **channel creation**, **membership**, **RLS**, **notifications**, **audit logs**, and **messaging** (including **threads**, **attachments**, and **reactions**).

---

## **1. Creating and Using a Public Channel**

**User Story:**  
> As a **new user**, I want to **sign up**, **sign in**, and create a **public channel** so that I can **send messages**, see **real-time updates**, and verify **presence** and **auto-join** features.

### **Key Checks**  
1. **User Management**  
   - Sign up with email/password; verify user data in the `users` table.  
   - Sign in; confirm an auth token is issued.  
2. **Channel System**  
   - Create a **public channel**; user auto-assigned as admin (`channel_members` role = `admin`).  
   - Send a message in the channel. If a second user sends a message in the public channel without membership, they auto-join on first message.  
3. **Messaging System**  
   - Confirm messages appear in real time.  
   - Check `messages` table for correct `channel_id`, `user_id`.  
   - Validate `last_read_at` updates for each user in `channel_members`.  
4. **Presence & Unread Count**  
   - Verify user’s `last_seen` is updated; confirm an unread count is visible to the second user before they open the channel.  
5. **Notifications (Optional)**  
   - If there are any relevant notifications for public channels (e.g., new channel creation for others), confirm they appear in the `notifications` table.

## **2. Private Channel with Access Requests**

**User Story:**  
> As a **non-admin user**, I want to **request access** to a **private channel**, wait for an **admin** to approve or deny, and receive **notifications** so that we can securely control membership.

### **Key Checks**  
1. **Private Channel Creation**  
   - Admin user creates a private channel (`is_private = true`).  
   - Confirm admin’s membership is stored with the role `admin`.  
2. **Access Requests**  
   - Second user attempts to open this private channel; sees “Request Access” button.  
   - Submits a request (`access_requests` row with status = `'pending'`).  
   - Confirm unique constraint on concurrent requests in `access_requests` works (no second pending request).  
3. **Notifications & Admin Approval**  
   - Admin receives a new **notification** (`type = 'access_request'`) in the `notifications` table.  
   - Admin approves the request:
     - Request status changes to `'approved'`.  
     - The user automatically joins the channel (`channel_members`).  
   - Second user sees **notification** that request was approved (`type = 'request_approved'`).  
4. **RLS & Membership**  
   - Second user can now read and write messages in the private channel.  
   - Confirm real-time messaging, unread counts, and presence updates.  
5. **Audit Logging**  
   - Check `audit_logs` table for an entry about the second user being **added** to the channel (`member_added`) and the access request going from `'pending'` to `'approved'`.

## **3. Advanced Messaging & Deletion**

**User Story:**  
> As an **admin**, I want to **add threaded messages**, **upload a file attachment**, **react to a message**, **edit my messages**, and finally **delete the channel**, so that I can verify all advanced message features and confirm cleanup/auditing upon channel deletion.

### **Key Checks**  
1. **Threading**  
   - Admin posts a **top-level message** in the channel.  
   - Another user replies with a **threaded message** (`parent_message_id`).  
   - Confirm the message structure in the `messages` table and real-time display in the UI.  
2. **File Attachments**  
   - Admin attaches an image or file (`file_url` in `messages`).  
   - Verify it appears in the `storage.objects` table (if debugging behind the scenes).  
   - Check that private channel attachments are not publicly accessible.  
3. **Reactions**  
   - Admin (or another user) toggles a reaction on the message (`reactions` table).  
   - Confirm real-time updates for the reaction appear.  
4. **Message Editing**  
   - Admin edits the content of their message.  
   - Check `edited_at` and `is_edited` in the `messages` table.  
5. **Channel Deletion**  
   - Admin deletes the channel.  
   - Confirm that associated **access requests** are archived, **messages** are removed, **channel_members** is cleared, and relevant **audit logs** are generated (`channel_deleted`).  
   - Ensure the `audit_logs` table records channel deletion and membership removal.

## **Using These User Stories**

1. **Incremental Testing**  
   - Implement each story’s UI flow step by step.  
   - Verify the database updates (RLS policies, triggers, real-time) at each stage.  
2. **Error Handling and Edge Cases**  
   - Attempt invalid actions (e.g., re-requesting access, editing another user’s message) to confirm RLS prevents them.  
3. **Performance Observations**  
   - Check that newly created indexes keep queries performant (e.g., searching channels or messages).  

By walking through these three user stories, you’ll cover **end-to-end** functionality: from **user signup/signin** to **channel creation**, **membership** (public & private), **messaging** (threads, edits, attachments, reactions), **notifications**, **audit logs**, and **channel deletion**.
