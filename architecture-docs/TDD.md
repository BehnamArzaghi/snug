Below is a **Technical Design Document (TDD)** focusing on the **testing strategy** for Snug (“ChatGenius”). It assumes a **single engineer** developing locally on one machine, handling **unit, integration, and end-to-end tests** in a straightforward manner. This document covers how tests are structured, run, and validated to ensure product quality without large, distributed environments.

---

# 1. **Scope & Goals**

1. **Comprehensive Testing Coverage**: Cover critical features—channels, messages (including threads), file upload, presence, and basic AI auto-responses.  
2. **Local-First Approach**: All tests should be runnable on a single engineer’s laptop.  
3. **Efficiency & Clarity**: Minimize setup overhead; provide a clear structure for writing and running tests.  
4. **Iterative Development**: Support incremental feature releases and TDD (Test-Driven Development) style, so tests are written (or updated) alongside feature implementation.

---

# 2. **Local Testing Environment**

1. **Core Tools**  
   - **Node.js** >= 18 (recommended for Next.js and modern JS features).  
   - **Jest** for unit testing.  
   - **React Testing Library (RTL)** for component-level tests.  
   - **Playwright** or **Cypress** for E2E tests.  
   - **Supabase CLI (Optional)** for spinning up a local DB or using a hosted test project.

2. **Dev & Test Setup**  
   - **Git Branching**: Each feature or bug fix gets its own branch with tests included.  
   - **.env.test**: Local environment variables for test mode (to ensure we don’t pollute production or dev DB).  
   - **Package Scripts**:  
     ```json
     {
       "scripts": {
         "test:unit": "jest --config jest.config.js",
         "test:integration": "jest --config jest.config.integration.js",
         "test:e2e": "cypress run",
         "test": "npm run test:unit && npm run test:integration && npm run test:e2e"
       }
     }
     ```

3. **Database Considerations**  
   - **Option A**: Spin up a local Supabase instance (via Docker or CLI).  
   - **Option B**: Use a remote Supabase test project with dummy data, protected by row-level security.  
   - **Cleanup**: Each test suite can drop/recreate tables or run migrations to maintain a clean slate.

# 3. **Test Strategy & Layers**

We employ **three main layers** of testing: **Unit**, **Integration**, and **End-to-End**.

## 3.1 Unit Tests

### 3.1.1 Purpose
- Validate **individual functions** or **React components** in isolation.  
- Quickly catch logic errors, ensuring core functionality and data transformations work as intended.

### 3.1.2 Tools & Framework
- **Jest** for test runner.  
- **React Testing Library** (RTL) to verify component output, props, and internal states without focusing on implementation details.

### 3.1.3 Examples of Unit Test Cases
1. **Channel Creation Form**  
   - Validate duplicate name detection logic.  
   - Verify correct error message if the name is too long or missing.  
2. **Threaded Message Function**  
   - Confirm that `parent_message_id` is set correctly for replies.  
   - Check boundary conditions (no channel_id but valid parent_message_id).  
3. **AI Prompt Generator**  
   - Pass a mock conversation array to ensure correct summarization or context slicing.  
   - Verify toggles: if AI is disabled, no prompt generation occurs.

## 3.2 Integration Tests

### 3.2.1 Purpose
- Test multiple modules or components **working together** (e.g., the entire flow of creating a channel and posting a threaded reply).  
- Confirm that the backend (Supabase) and frontend flows (Next.js pages) integrate seamlessly.

### 3.2.2 Tools & Setup
- **Jest** can still be used, but with a separate **integration config**.  
- Mock or actual **Supabase** calls for partial real-time checks.  
  - **Option**: Use a “test” Supabase instance to do real operations.

### 3.2.3 Examples of Integration Test Cases
1. **Channel Creation + User Invite**  
   - Script logs in as a test user → calls “create channel” → invites another test user → checks DB insertion and real-time subscription.  
2. **Threaded Conversation**  
   - User A posts a top-level message → user B replies → verify the reply is in `messages` table with correct parent ID → check both UI states (thread appears under the parent).  
3. **File Upload Flow**  
   - Drag-and-drop an image (simulate in test environment) → confirm the file is stored in Supabase Storage → a message is created with `file_url`. → UI displays thumbnail.

## 3.3 End-to-End (E2E) Tests

### 3.3.1 Purpose
- Simulate **real user journeys** in a browser, from login to message posting, ensuring the entire system behaves correctly.

### 3.3.2 Tools
- **Playwright** or **Cypress** recommended for E2E.  
- They spin up a local server (`npm run dev`) or use a staging environment, then automate real browser actions.

### 3.3.3 Examples of E2E Test Cases
1. **Full Channel Flow**  
   - Log in as “Jessica” → create a new channel → invite “Alex” → verify Alex sees the channel → post a few messages (including a threaded reply) → check presence changes.  
2. **AI Auto-Response**  
   - Turn AI on for “Kevin,” log him out or set him “offline.”  
   - Another user @mentions Kevin → verify AI responds in the channel or thread with an AI-labeled message.  
3. **File Upload & Preview**  
   - Upload multiple images in a thread → confirm correct thumbnail loading, error messages for large files, etc.

# 4. **Coverage Targets & Metrics**

1. **Unit & Integration Coverage**: Aim for **80%** line coverage across critical modules (channels, messaging, threading, AI logic).  
2. **E2E Coverage**: Focus on **core user flows** (≥90% test coverage for main tasks: channel creation, message posting, searching, AI toggle).  
3. **Thread Testing**: Validate at least **2-3 test cases** for threaded messages—single reply, multiple replies, offline user replying, etc.  
4. **File Upload**: Ensure coverage for image acceptance, size rejections, error states, and success messages.

---

# 5. **Test Data Management**

1. **Seed Data**  
   - Local scripts or migrations to create test users (e.g., “Jessica,” “Kevin,” “Alex”) with known credentials.  
   - Pre-seeded channels for integration testing.  
2. **Cleanup Strategy**  
   - After each test run, revert DB to a baseline state or delete newly created data.  
   - Some E2E flows might preserve data for debugging but keep it well-labeled (e.g., “TEST-Channel-<timestamp>”).

---

# 6. **Performance & Stress Testing (Optional)**

1. **Local Load Testing**: Since only one engineer is testing, we can do a basic performance check using small scripts (e.g., `k6` or `locust`) hitting the local server.  
2. **AI Latency**: Verify that AI context fetch + response generation remains <2 seconds average. If it spikes, investigate local CPU constraints or consider offloading to a remote AI service for that test.

---

# 7. **Test Execution & Reporting**

1. **Manual vs. Automated**  
   - Ideally, all tests are run automatically via `npm run test`.  
   - The engineer can also run **selective** tests (e.g., `npm run test:e2e` for full E2E or `npm run test:unit` for quick checks).  
2. **Frequency**  
   - **On-Commit**: Run unit and integration tests.  
   - **Daily**: E2E tests or on a separate “test/staging” branch.  
3. **Reporting**  
   - Jest coverage reports in console + HTML output.  
   - E2E logs for pass/fail screenshots in Cypress/Playwright.  
4. **Debugging**  
   - If a test fails, investigate local logs, DB data, or screenshots (E2E).  
   - Possibly attach a debugger in Node or use a “Cypress open” interactive mode.

# 8. **Edge Cases & Potential Pitfalls**

1. **Limited Resources**: Only one machine means we can’t replicate large concurrency.  
   - **Mitigation**: Keep real-time tests minimal but thorough.  
2. **Network Variability**: Local environment might not mimic real-world latencies.  
   - **Mitigation**: Optionally simulate slow networks in E2E with network throttling.  
3. **AI External Calls**: If using a remote AI API, tests might break if credentials or network is down.  
   - **Mitigation**: Use a mock AI service or a local stub during test runs.  

---

# 9. **Maintenance & Future Considerations**

1. **Test Refactoring**  
   - Keep test code DRY (don’t repeat data setup for each test).  
   - Build utility functions for recurring tasks (e.g., “createChannelAndInviteUser” or “loginAsUser”).  
2. **Parallelization**  
   - As the suite grows, consider test parallelization. Locally, we’re limited to single-engineer use but can still benefit from multi-threaded Jest runs.  
3. **Integration with CI**  
   - Even if currently run locally, the project can easily adopt a CI pipeline (GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, etc.) in the future.  

---

# 10. **Open Questions & Next Steps**

1. **Mocks vs. Real Supabase**  
   - Decide if we fully mock DB calls for integration tests or rely on a test DB. Recommendation: A dedicated test DB for realistic coverage.  
2. **AI Model Variation**  
   - If multiple LLM endpoints exist, how do we unify tests? Possibly set a single “test” endpoint and consistent prompt responses.  
3. **Access & Cleanup**  
   - Ensure the test user credentials are easy to manage, and cleanup scripts are well-documented in `README.md`.

## **Conclusion**

This TDD outlines a straightforward **local-first** testing approach for Snug. With unit, integration, and E2E layers, we capture coverage across channels, threaded messaging, file uploads, presence, and basic AI auto-responses. By following these guidelines, the single engineer can confidently **iterate, refactor, and release** features with minimal risk—ensuring a stable codebase that meets the **functional, performance, and user experience** goals outlined in the PRD and SDD.
