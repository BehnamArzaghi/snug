Below is a **reconciled, up-to-date checklist** that merges the original “Main Checklist,” the “Audit,” and the “Differences Assessment,” reflecting the project’s **current** state. Items that were previously marked as incomplete but are now verified in the code have been updated to **(✓)** with completion notes, while items that remain partially done or not implemented are explicitly labeled.

---

# Snug Implementation Checklist (Reconciled Version)

## Review Procedure
After each implementation iteration:
1. Update checklist items with completion status (✓) and timestamps (including hour and minute)  
2. Document any challenges encountered and their solutions  
3. Note any deviations from original plans and their rationale  
4. Track performance implications and technical debt  
5. Update "Key Implementation Notes" section with new learnings  

## Development Best Practices (Updated: Jan 8, 2024)
1. Port Management:
   ```bash
   # Clear port 3000 if in use
   lsof -i :3000 | grep LISTEN | awk '{print $2}' | xargs kill -9
   ```
2. Code Organization:
   - Use Pages Router for routing
   - Keep components in src/components
   - Keep hooks in src/lib/hooks
   - Keep types in src/lib/types
3. Testing Protocol:
   - Test all flows in incognito/private window
   - Clear localStorage between tests
   - Test both happy and error paths
4. Error Documentation Protocol:
   - Document all encountered errors with:
     - Error context and symptoms
     - Root cause analysis
     - Resolution steps
     - Prevention measures
5. Implementation Verification:
   - Test in development before marking complete
   - Document any deviations from original plan
   - Note all dependencies and configurations needed
6. Next.js Configuration:
   - Document all next.config.js changes
   - Test configuration changes by restarting server
   - Verify changes in both dev and build

   - Verified real-time subscription logic in code.  

2. **Presence System**  
   - Basic UI in place (displays online/offline), but background “ping” for robust presence tracking is incomplete.  

3. **File Sharing**  
   - UI done, partial code for uploads present, final Supabase Storage integration needed.  

4. **Search**  
   - Fully implemented with pg_trgm, GIN index, fuzzy matching, and context messages.  

5. **Real-time Messaging**  
   - Verified in `MessageList.tsx` (lines 62–78). No duplication, instant updates.  

6. **Audit vs. Checklist Mismatches**  
   - **Resolved** by updating statuses (e.g., Channel View, Real-time messaging, Message Input).  

7. **Ongoing Testing & Deployment**  
   - Need cross-browser testing, final Lighthouse/performance audits, Vercel integration, and thorough docs.
